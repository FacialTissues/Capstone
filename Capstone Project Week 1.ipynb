This project is mainly focused on geospatial analysis of the Hyderabad City to understand which would be the best place to open a new mall. Using data science methodology and machine learning techniques like clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In the city of Hyderabad, if a property developer is looking to open a new shopping mall, where would you recommend that they open it?\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Data where you describe the data that will be used to solve the problem and the source of the data.\n\nTo solve the problem, we will need the following data:\n\u2022 List of neighbourhoods in Hyderabad. This defines the scope of this project which is confined to the city of Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana, which is in South India\n\u2022 Latitude and longitude coordinates of those neighbourhoods. This is required in order to plot the map and also to get the venue data\n\u2022 Venue data, particularly data related to shopping malls. We will use this data to perform clustering on the neighbourhoods\n\nUsing Wikipedia page is a list of neighbourhoods in Hyderabad, with 200 neighbourhoods. I have used web scraping techniques to extract the data from the Wikipedia page, with the help of Python requests and beautifulsoup packages. Then we can get the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighbourhoods using Python Geocoder package. After that, I have used the Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods.\nFoursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, and we are particularly interested in the Shopping Mall category in order to help us solve the business problem. This is a project that will make use of many data science skills, from web scraping (Wikipedia), working with API (Foursquare), data cleaning, data wrangling, to machine learning (K-means clustering) and map visualization (Folium)."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Methodology section which represents the main component of the report where you discuss and describe any exploratory data analysis that you did, any inferential statistical testing that you performed, if any, and what machine learnings were used and why.\n\nThe Foursquare API allows application developers to interact with the Foursquare platform.

If we decide a place where the competition is less, then we need to consider the people living in that locality as well. If the people in that area spend a lot and love going out then it\u2019ll be a success. If the people staying near the mall don't prefer going out, then it's better to consider some other place with less competition and a good crowd."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**Conclusion section where you conclude the report.\n\nA good number of shopping malls are concentrated in the central area of Hyderabad city. Cluster 0 has a very low number of malls. This represents a great opportunity and high potential areas to open new shopping malls, as there is very little to no competition from existing malls. Meanwhile, shopping malls in cluster 2 are likely suffering from intense competition because of oversupply and a high concentration of shopping malls. Therefore, this project recommends property developers to capitalize on these findings to open new shopping malls in neighbourhoods in cluster 0 with little to no competition. Property developers with unique selling propositions to stand out from the competition can also open new shopping malls in neighbourhoods in cluster 1 with moderate competition. Lastly, property developers are advised to avoid neighbourhoods in cluster 2 which already have a high concentration of shopping malls and suffering from intense competition."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
