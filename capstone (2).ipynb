Then we can get the latitude and longitude coordinates of the neighbourhoods using Python Geocoder package. After that, I have used the Foursquare API to get the venue data for those neighbourhoods.\nFoursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, and we are particularly interested in the Shopping Mall category in order to help us solve the business problem.

Cluster 0 has a very low number of malls. This represents a great opportunity and high potential areas to open new shopping malls, as there is very little to no competition from existing malls. Meanwhile, shopping malls in cluster 2 are likely suffering from intense competition because of oversupply and a high concentration of shopping malls. Therefore, this project recommends property developers to capitalize on these findings to open new shopping malls in neighbourhoods in cluster 0 with little to no competition. Property developers with unique selling propositions to stand out from the competition can also open new shopping malls in neighbourhoods in cluster 1 with moderate competition. Lastly, property developers are advised to avoid neighbourhoods in cluster 2 which already have a high concentration of shopping malls and suffering from intense competition."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
